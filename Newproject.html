        <p>Event management is the process of creating and maintaining an event. This process spans from the very beginning of planning all the way to post-event strategizing.

            At the start, an event manager makes planning decisions, such as the time, location, and theme of their event. During an event, event managers oversee the event live and make sure things run smoothly. After an event, event managers are tasked with reviewing event data, submitting KPI and ROI findings, and staying on the ball for any post-event offerings.
            
            All different branches of planning go into event management, including various types of sourcing, designing, regulation checks, and on-site management. In event management, you could be in the process of creating a conference, a product launch, an internal sales kick-off, or even a wedding. Really, any event that requires considerable planning and execution is event management.

            Shopping is an activity in which a customer browses the available goods or services presented by one or more retailers with the potential intent to purchase a suitable selection of them. A typology of shopper types has been developed by scholars which identifies one group of shoppers as recreational shoppers,[1] that is, those who enjoy shopping and view it as a leisure activity.[
